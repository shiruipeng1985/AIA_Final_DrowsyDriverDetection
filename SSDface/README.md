## SSDface
Someone uses the Single Shot Detection (SSD) to do face detection and trained by caffe framework. The performance is good so we used it as a reference. You need to download the following two files to use it:
- [deploy.prototxt.txt](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/dnn/face_detector/deploy.prototxt)
- [res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_3rdparty/blob/dnn_samples_face_detector_20170830/res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel)
